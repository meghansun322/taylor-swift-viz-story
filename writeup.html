                <h2>Motivating Problem</h2>
                <p>Taylor Swift, one of the most popular artists globally today, has had six international tours during
                    her
                    music career. We are examining the popularity, in terms of attendance and revenue, of each of these
                    tours to discover how her popularity has changed over time and how this has impacted her concerts.
                </p>

                <h2>Why it Matters
                </h2>
                <p>In Miss Americana (2020), a documentary about Swift’s life as an artist, she says, “we do exist in
                    this
                    society where women in entertainment are discarded in an elephant graveyard by the time they're 35…
                    As
                    I'm reaching 30, I'm like, I want to work really hard while society is still tolerating me being
                    successful.” She was feeling fearful about her age invalidating her art at a certain point, even
                    while
                    she was merely 30 years old. </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    As she points out, there is a stereotype within the broader entertainment industry about what a
                    woman is
                    able to accomplish past a certain age, how a woman is able to be past a certain age. This is why our
                    motivating problem matters; we would like to confront this stereotype with a case study of Swift’s
                    popularity in her tours as a nearly 34 year-old.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, examining data about tour attendance and revenue in general is important for so many
                    stakeholders. Venues, marketing teams, and artists all need data like this to plan their budget for
                    the
                    demand and revenue expected from a tour. Additionally, this data could be useful for fans who are
                    planning to see an artist’s concert; if they know how high the demand will be, for example, they may
                    know to try to secure tickets more quickly.
                </p>

                <h2>Data</h2>
                <p>The dataset to visualize tour revenue and attendance was sourced from Kaggle [1] and cleaned by our
                    team.
                    The set contains information about the venue, city, and country where each concert took place, the
                    tour
                    each show was associated with, the opening acts that performed, the attendance in number of tickets
                    sold, and the concert’s revenue generated by ticket sales. For our visualization, we will group all
                    the
                    shows from each tour together and examine their total attendance and revenue.
                </p>

                <h2>Tasks</h2>
                <p>For our motivating problem, we will design a visualization that aims to accomplish the following
                    tasks:
                    Is there a correlation between tour attendance and revenue, and if so, how strong is the
                    correlation?
                    Which one of Taylor Swift’s tours has had the highest revenue, and which has had the highest
                    attendance?
                    Do her tours now have higher revenue than the previous tours?
                    Using tour attendance and revenue as a proxy for popularity, on which tour was Taylor Swift the most
                    popular?
                </p>

                <h2>Our Preliminary Viz & Design Choices
                </h2>

                <p>The preliminary visualization can be seen in the following visualization tool, in the “Tour Revenue
                    and
                    Attendance” section:
                    <a
                        href="https://meghansun322.github.io/taylor-swift-data-story/">https://meghansun322.github.io/taylor-swift-data-story/</a>
                    In the preliminary visualization, revenue and attendance were grouped by tour and displayed on
                    separate
                    bar graphs, where each bar represents a tour. There is a button that allows users to interactively
                    switch between the bar graphs. Additionally, each bar is colored based on the tour’s primary color.
                    After the initial design, the color choice of the bars in the bar graphs is a design choice that we
                    would like to investigate further. Our decision to employ a color scheme reflecting each tour’s
                    primary
                    color is influenced by our belief that it would more effectively capture user attention and
                    distinguish
                    each tour’s achievements. Ultimately, we would like to investigate whether there exists a color
                    scheme
                    that can more aptly convey Taylor Swift’s tour achievements.
                </p>

                <h2>Experiment Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Target Question:
                    How can we best create a visualization to resonate with a large audience? We are looking to
                    determine how viewers are interpreting our current preliminary visualization and have the following
                    design question: how do viewers analyze and interpret color in a graph? What kind of color scheme
                    would work best for this visualization tool?

                    Below is a screenshot of our original, preliminary visualization for our target problem:

                    <br>
                    <img src="img/BarChartAttendance.png" width="80%" />
                    <img src="img/BarChartRevenue.png" width="80%" />
                    <br>

                    The colors of each tour bar are based on the color Taylor Swift chose for the corresponding “era” in
                    her Eras Tour. Below is a screenshot of an Eras Tour post, referencing each concert/era and its
                    color.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As data visualization designers, we’re curious to see if non-Taylor Swift fans note any meaning to
                    the colors in this visualization, and how viewers are interpreting the colors as a whole.

                </p>

                <h2>Experiment Description:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To analyze viewers’ interpretation of color, we’ve prepared three different color schemes for the
                    graphs. One is the original color scheme, with the colors based on each “era”, a second one contains
                    randomized, bright colors, and a third focuses on highlighting the most recent concert.

                    <div class="flex">

                    <p>
                        We will split participants into three groups. Each group is assigned one color scheme graph to
                        look
                        at and each group is labeled based on a shape. The circle group will be viewing the brightly
                        colored, randomized color scheme. The square group will be viewing the original, eras color
                        scheme.
                        Lastly, the triangle group will be viewing the color scheme that highlights the most recent tour
                        (the Era’s tour). Each participant will be shown their assigned color-scheme graph for 10
                        seconds.
                        After viewing their assigned color-scheme graph, participants will answer a questionnaire
                        (detailed
                        below in the experimental tasks section). This questionnaire is focusing on what information
                        they
                        were able to remember after viewing the graph and what information stuck out after viewing the
                        graph
                        for a short period of time. They will have about 2.5 minutes to complete this short form.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        After completing this first part of the experiment, all groups will then view a link that shows
                        all
                        three graphs and color scheme options. They will then answer another questionnaire. As opposed
                        to
                        the first part of the experiment, here participants will have access to the visualizations while
                        they fill out the form, and this part is not strictly timed. This questionnaire will be focusing
                        on
                        viewer’s opinions on the color schemes and will also ask some demographic questions (such as if
                        they’re a fan of Taylor Swift or not).
                    </p>

                </p>

                <h2>Independent, dependent, and control variables
                </h2>

                <p>The independent variable of this experiment will be the choice of color palette used in the bar
                    graph. As shown above, we will use a set of three modified color palettes - the original color
                    palette matching the tour colors, a higher contrast color palette, and a color palette that just
                    highlights the most recent tour.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The dependent variable of this experiment will be the user’s comprehension of the visualization and
                    the data presented within it. This metric will be measured based on the results of a questionnaire
                    given to consumers of the visualization. The design of the questionnaire is shown in the next
                    section.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    In this experiment, the chart type, axis labels, data presented, and sorting of data within the
                    visualization will remain controlled. This ensures that no confounding variables are present that
                    might unexpectedly skew our results, and ensures that the independent variable selected is the only
                    factor of the visualization changing in the experiment.</p>

                <h2>Our Hypothesis
                </h2>
                <p>We predict that the original color palette will be the most effective at conveying the data and
                    change in revenue for each Taylor Swift tour. We believe that the color differences between each
                    mark will make each tour more discernible - something that the color palette that just highlights
                    the most recent tour may struggle with. In addition, the colors of the original palette are more
                    easy on the eyes than the brightly colored dataset, allowing users to more easily scan the dataset
                    and compare each tour.
                </p>

                <h2>Experimental Tasks
                </h2>
                <p>For a detailed description of the experiment, see the Experiment Description section above.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Each participant will view their assigned color-scheme graph and then answer the following
                    questionnaire:
                    Part 1 Form: <a href="https://forms.gle/wXURZ92ydoVzH9fA9">https://forms.gle/wXURZ92ydoVzH9fA9</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Each participant will view all three color-scheme graphs and then answer the following
                    questionnaire:
                    Part 2 Form: <a href="https://forms.gle/jBQrAtTuNRP8vL67A">https://forms.gle/jBQrAtTuNRP8vL67A</a>
                </p>

                <h2>Analysis Plan
                </h2>
                <p>From this experiment, we will collect our Google Form data in a spreadsheet with each participant’s
                    response. This data will include responses to multiple choice, short answer, and ranked order
                    questions about our visualization and some details of the participant’s demographics.
                    To analyze our data, we will divide the responses into three categories that correspond to the three
                    different color schemes the groups were assigned to view. In each category, we will calculate the
                    following metrics based on our data: the percentage of participants who got the highest tour details
                    correct, the percentage of participants who got the lowest tour details correct, and the overall
                    percentage of correct items selected across the entire group. Then, we will compare these metrics
                    across all three color groups to determine if there are any statistically significant performance
                    differences, and therefore begin answering our target question. If we have time for extending our
                    analysis, we are also interested in examining how being a self-identified Taylor Swift fan–or
                    not–impacted the results.
                </p>

                <h2>Limitations
                </h2>
                <p>With the limited scope of our experimental design process and run, there are several limitations and
                    confounding variables that may impact our results. First of all, this experiment was conducted on a
                    very limited number of participants, and they were all of the same age range. We also conducted this
                    experiment early in the morning, which may have impacted people’s memory and performance. If any
                    participants were color-blind or have any other visual impairments, this may also influence our
                    results.
                    Additionally, whether or not our participants had prior knowledge or bias about Taylor Swift and/or
                    her tours would definitely impact our results. If any other factors of the visualization designs
                    besides the colors influenced people’s understanding of the data, this would also be a confounding
                    variable. However, we tried to control for this issue by keeping every aspect of the visualizations
                    (besides the color) the same across all participants.
