                Today, we are exploring the domination of Taylor Swift. We explore the records she's
                shattering,
                her unique solo appeal in an era of collaboration, and how her tour is tapping into the experience
                economy.

                <br>
                <br>
                Swift’s re-recorded albums — a campaign she has embarked on following the sale of her first 6 album
                masters to music mogul Scooter Braun — have arguably intensified the love story between the artist and
                her loyal fanbase of "Swifties", as evidenced by the demand for her Eras World Tour.
